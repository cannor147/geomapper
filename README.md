# GeoMapper

Simply, this is a lightweight tool for creating colored map, based on countries (or territories) data.
It has three ways of colorization:
* straight mode for colorization of country sets in some colors
* scale mode for colorization of countries based on value (gdp, hdr, population, etc.)
* step mode, which is similar to scale mode, but it groups countries depends on value (for example, it can color countries with population between 10M and 100M in one color).
